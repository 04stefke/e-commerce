## About
My name is Stefan Jovanovic. I am a front-end developer, this is a basic e-commerce site.

## Introduction
The basic e-commerce website with only one item but lots of features!! It was an ending project for my course.

## The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
